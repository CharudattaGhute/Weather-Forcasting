# Weather-Forcasting
Welcome to the Weather Forecasting project repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast weather patterns in Delhi. By employing Python and various libraries, we aim to uncover insights into mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, temperature changes, and the relationship between temperature and humidity over the years.

# Features

- Mean Temperature Analysis: Explore the mean temperature trends in Delhi over the years to identify any patterns or anomalies.
- Humidity Analysis: Dive into the humidity data for Delhi and gain insights into how it fluctuates over time.
- Wind Speed Examination: Analyze the wind speed patterns in Delhi to understand its behavior in different seasons.
- Temperature-Humidity Relationship: Investigate the relationship between temperature and humidity to find correlations and dependencies.
- Temperature Change Over the Years: Visualize the changes in temperature over time to detect long-term trends.

# Libraries Used
This project utilizes several Python libraries to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize the weather data.
- Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful data structures and tools to efficiently clean and preprocess the weather data.
- NumPy: NumPy is employed for numerical computations. It's an essential library for performing mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.
- Seaborn: Seaborn is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It aids in creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- Plotly: Plotly is another visualization library that provides interactive and dynamic visualizations, enabling users to explore the data more effectively.
- Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a widely-used plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Prophet: Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook. It's used for time series forecasting and is particularly helpful for capturing seasonality and holidays.

# How These Libraries are Useful

- Pandas: Pandas simplifies data preprocessing by providing tools for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation. It helps in handling missing data and converting data into a format suitable for analysis.

- NumPy: NumPy's array operations facilitate efficient mathematical computations on the weather data, making it easier to perform calculations and generate statistical insights.

- Seaborn: Seaborn's high-level functions enable the creation of aesthetically pleasing and informative visualizations with minimal code. It enhances the presentation of data trends and relationships.

- Plotly: Plotly's interactive visualizations allow users to zoom in, pan, and hover over data points for more detailed exploration. It adds an interactive layer to the project's visual outputs.

- Matplotlib: Matplotlib provides fine-grained control over plot customization. It's particularly useful for generating static visualizations with a high degree of precision.

- Prophet: Prophet automates the process of time series forecasting, handling seasonality, holidays, and other factors that influence weather patterns. It simplifies the forecasting process and enhances prediction accuracy.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Weather Forecasting project, powered by Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Prophet, aims to uncover meaningful insights from Delhi's weather data. By analyzing temperature, humidity, wind speed, temperature changes, and their relationships, our goal is to enhance understanding of climate trends.

Through interactive visualizations and a user-friendly repository, we encourage further exploration and customization. As you move forward, consider refining forecasting accuracy through advanced techniques and external data integration.
